### Minor Changes

- b53c262: A clip change can now blend, and a finished clip stays on its last frame.

    `useClipPlayer` takes a `blendSeconds` option: the seconds to blend out of whatever was
    playing and into the newly declared clip. A clip may also declare the length once, in its
    manifest sheet, as `blendInSeconds`. Omitting the option falls back to that authored
    length, and to no blend when the sheet declares none — so a game that declares neither
    keeps the cut it has today. A `blendSeconds` at the call site overrides an authored one,
    including with a `0`, which asks for a cut. Both are wall-clock seconds and neither
    scales with the dilation multiplier, so a transition takes as long in a slowed-down scene
    as it does at full speed.

    `AnimatedSprite` and `useSpriteClipPlayer` deliberately do NOT take `blendSeconds`: a
    sprite playback rewrites quad UVs and has no weight to interpolate. A sprite clip's sheet
    may still author `blendInSeconds` — the sheet is shared vocabulary — and no sprite
    backend honours it.

    Behaviour an adopter sees without asking for anything:
    - A clip change now closes the outgoing clip's open passages with reason
      `'clip-changed'` instead of `'stopped'`, whether or not a blend was asked for. A
      `loop` change and a `sheet` change do the same. `'stopped'` now means what a caller
      asking for a stop gets — `stop(name)`, `stopAll()`, or declaring `clip: null` — and
      `'released'` still means the player was disposed. A game switching on
      `PassageEndEvent.reason` should read the new value.
    - A `'once'` clip that reaches its end now HOLDS its last frame instead of restoring the
      model's original state on the same tick its `clip-end` handler runs. The pose comes
      down when something asks the player for a change — including declaring another clip,
      which blends out of the held frame when it declares a blend and cuts it when it does
      not.

    An authored `blendInSeconds` that is not a finite number of at least zero now fails
    `validate-assets` at build time, naming the clip, and is dropped with a warning by the
    runtime sheet parser if it reaches one.

- a2f7d10: Close the animation system (F82): author the two remaining invariants, and amend the prose the
  code falsified.

    **Invariant #129** (the last reserved slot, now authored) states that beat-owned gameplay windows
    are host-only — `StateProjector.project()`'s field allowlist omits the registry, so no window
    record ever crosses a boundary — that records are integer or `FixedPoint` throughout because the
    registry is saved and replayed, that `AnimationWindowManager`'s three verbs are pure, and that
    within a match a window leaves through one of the manager's FOUR paths, each reported with a
    distinguishing reason: `'expired'`, `'owner-gone'` (checked first, so it stays the truthful reason
    on the beat the countdown would also have run out), `'replaced'` and `'interrupted'`. The MATCH
    BOUNDARY is deliberately named as not being one of them — `animationWindows` is match-scoped, so
    `engine:start_game` and `engine:return_to_lobby` drop the whole registry with no per-window event,
    in the same reduce that drops a game's own extension fields.

    **Invariant #132** states as a numbered rule that no animation event may gate an
    `EngineAction`. A clip's marks report where a playhead is, and a gameplay consequence derived
    from one would be derived from the frame clock, which no two machines share. The rule is held by
    ABSENT PARAMETERS — `ClipMarkerHandlers` and every event it carries name no dispatcher, no
    `SendAction`, no `PlayerId` and no tick — so a handler has nothing to dispatch with. Stated as an
    invariant rather than left to be inferred from one hook's signature, because a future animation
    surface adding a parameter would be adding it to a shape no rule had claimed.

    The prose sweep is the other half, and it is about one word. `GameSnapshot.tick` counts ACTIONS,
    not beats: an `engine:tick` that fires a timer dispatches children through the same
    `ActionPipeline.process()`, and each one advances the counter. Every doc line that treated the
    two as the same number is amended — most importantly the action-pipeline claim that "each
    `engine:tick` advances the counter by 1", which is exactly what would make a `tick`-difference
    animation clock look correct. `ReplayPlayer`'s "+1 tick per recorded action" is restated as what
    it is, a REFUSAL that bounds what is replayable (a nested `ctx.dispatch` and `engine:undo`/`redo`
    are not), and the two measurably-false replay lines are deleted rather than sharpened.

    No runtime behaviour changes: this is the documentation and invariant half of a feature whose
    code landed across the tasks before it, plus one new engine-side test pinning #132's parameter
    census.

## 1.0.0-rc.0

### Major Changes

- M10 — first public release (`1.0.0`). Adopt the locked `1.X.Y` versioning scheme: every
  `@chimera-engine/*` engine package and the `create-chimera-game` initializer now share one
  version and re-publish together. This bump retires the independent `0.x` per-package semver
  and aligns the whole first-party set at `1.0.0`. Previewed on npm as `1.0.0-rc.0` under the
  `rc` dist-tag before the final release.

### Minor Changes

- da1f1cd: Let a spectator switch which seat they follow (F72 Spectator Mode). The `SPECTATE_TARGET_UPDATE` wire message is now plumbed end-to-end: the networking transports gain `ClientTransport.sendSpectateTarget(targetPlayerId)` and `HostTransport.onSpectateTargetUpdate((from, targetPlayerId) => …)` (mirrored across the local WebSocket provider — `WsClientTransport`, `MessageRouter`, `WsHostTransport` — and the `InMemoryMultiplayerProvider`); the host derives the spectator from the connection (never a client-supplied id, Invariant #99) and, after validating the requested target is a currently-seated player, re-points the viewer's `SpectatorRegistry` entry and immediately re-broadcasts the new-perspective projection — an unknown or non-seated target is ignored and the perspective is unchanged. A new renderer→main IPC seam drives it: `window.__chimera.spectate.setFollowedTarget(targetPlayerId)` sends the Zod-validated `chimera:spectate:set-target` channel (Invariant #5), which `LobbyManager.setSpectatorTarget` forwards over the joined session's transport. The message is out-of-band / cosmetic: never an `EngineAction`, never advances `tick`, and never enters `ActionHistory`, saves, or replays (Invariant #115).
- d8eacba: Make an admitted spectator actually see the match (Invariant #114). The electron host gains a `SpectatorRegistry` (host-local `spectatorId → followedPlayerId` ledger — never in `GameSnapshot.players`, saves, or replays) and `StateBroadcaster` learns a `spectators` view-source option: every broadcast wave now also sends each spectator `StateProjector.project(state, followedPlayerId)` (one send per wave via snapshot-reference dedupe, reusing the single projection gate — Invariant #8), clock-only ticks are forwarded once per tick value, and a new `broadcastSpectator()` unicasts the perspective snapshot at join time. A spectator joins following the first seated player, is re-pointed to the next seated player when its followed seat deliberately leaves (transient drops hold the target), and leaves the registry on disconnect with no seat release. Networking: `LobbyServer.sendToPlayer` now reaches spectator connections (previously a silent no-op, so spectators could never receive a snapshot), and an `ACTION` arriving on a spectator connection is dropped at the message boundary with a warn — belt-and-braces on top of the host-side registry check that also stops envelopes spoofing a seated player's id. Out-of-band client messages (chat, spectate-target updates) still route.
