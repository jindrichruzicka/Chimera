Fix the scaffolded app crashing at startup when `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` is set in the environment (some IDE/agent terminals and CI runners export it globally). In that state the `electron` binary runs as plain Node.js, so `require('electron')` resolves to the executable path string and every Electron API is `undefined` — a raw `electron apps/<game>` then died at module load with a cryptic `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`, which reads as "launching the app crashes the terminal".

- `create-chimera-game` now emits a `scripts/launch.mjs` launcher and a root `pnpm start` script that strip `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` before spawning Electron, so the documented run step works from any terminal. The README + next-steps now point at `pnpm start`.
- `@chimera-engine/electron` gains a startup `assertElectronRuntime` guard that turns the cryptic `TypeError` into an actionable message naming the cause and the fix (`unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, or use `pnpm start`).
