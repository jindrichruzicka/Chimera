/**

 *
 * Main-side registry mapping `gameId → GameLobbySetup`, plus the pure glue that
 * turns a live `LobbyState` into the `GameSetupConfig` carried into the match at
 * `engine:start_game`.
 *
 * This module is the designated *composition point* for game lobby descriptors:
 * it is the only place permitted to import `games/*` lobby-setup descriptors and
 * register them here (so `LobbyManager` stays free of game imports — Invariant
 * #2; it receives the resolver injected). The registry is intentionally EMPTY in
 * #706 (T4): the first concrete descriptor (Tactics) is registered in #708 (T6).
 * Until then every seeding path no-ops gracefully and behavior is byte-identical
 * to before this task.
 *
 * Architecture: §4.14 — LobbyManager; §4.4 — Lobby State Sync
 * Task: #706 (part of #702 — Customizable Lobby)
