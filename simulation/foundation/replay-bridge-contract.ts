/**
 * simulation/foundation/replay-bridge-contract.ts
 *
 * Shared structural contract for the slice of the Chimera preload replay bridge
 * (`window.__chimera.replay.perspective`) that a game's shell module reads
 * directly off `globalThis` to gate replay-related menu affordances.
 *
 * A game shell module (e.g. `apps/tactics/shell/main-menu.ts`) gates its
 * "Replays" button on whether any perspective replays exist, so it needs the
 * `list` slice of that bridge — this narrow, zero-import contract rather than
 * the whole canonical preload surface.
 *
 * Drift protection: `simulation/bridge/api-types.ts` declares
 * `PerspectiveReplayAPI extends PerspectiveReplayListBridge`, so the canonical
 * preload surface is structurally pinned to this shared slice — a change to
 * `list`'s signature that diverges from this contract is a compile error in the
 * preload layer. Both the game consumer and the canonical producer therefore
 * reference one source of truth for this method's shape.
 *
 * Module boundary (§3 Module Boundary Table): `simulation/` must not import from
 * `renderer/`, `electron/`, or `apps/*`. This module has zero imports — the
 * constraint is structurally enforced.
 */

/**
 * Reserved, opaque handle that stands in for the **in-progress, not-yet-saved**
 * recording of the just-finished match, instead of a real on-disk replay path.
 *
 * The post-game **Replay** action passes this to `openInPlayer` so the player
 * previews the match straight from the host's in-memory recording — the match is
 * NOT written to disk at game-over; the player's compact save icon is the sole
 * thing that persists it. Main recognises this token by exact equality **before**
 * any path-schema parse or directory-containment check and routes it to in-memory
 * playback (`openCurrent`), so it never reaches the filesystem — it is deliberately
 * NOT a valid path and can never escape the replay directory (OWASP A01 unaffected).
 *
 * Shared here so both the main-process IPC handlers and a game screen
 * reference one source of truth for the token.
