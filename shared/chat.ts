/**
 * shared/chat.ts
 *
 * Canonical chat contract shared across the host relay, the wire protocol, and
 * the renderer. This is the type surface F45 — Chat System (§4.29) builds on:
 * the routing scope, the relayed message shape, and the relay outcome.
 *
 * **Scope:** Types only — no relay logic, no validation, no UI. The host-side
 * `ChatRelay` (F45) assigns `id` + `serverTime`, applies the length cap, rate
 * limit, and scope validation (Invariant #73), then rebroadcasts per `scope`.
 *
 * Chat is a cosmetic communication channel. A `ChatMessage` is NEVER an
 * `EngineAction`: it must not advance `tick`, enter `ActionPipeline` /
 * `ActionHistory`, or appear in replays / saves (Invariant #72). It travels as
 * a `SideChannelMessage`, parallel to `PROFILE_UPDATE`.
 *
 * Architecture: §4.29 — Chat System
 * Task: F45 / T01 (issue #679)
 *
 * Invariants upheld:
 *   #2  — Zero runtime imports from electron/, renderer/, or DOM APIs;
 *         `PlayerId` is referenced via `import type` only.
 *   #72 — `ChatMessage` is a cosmetic side-channel payload, not an EngineAction.
